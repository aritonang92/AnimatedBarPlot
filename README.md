# AnimatedBarPlot
In this repository I create animated bar plot using #gganimate package of #rstats. The data that I used is The English Premier League result from season 1993/94 to 2019/20.
You can pull out that data from football-data.co.uk, in the website there are several years of league result so I merge all those files based on the variables. Remember that there are some missing data (NAs) presented there so you should handle it well.
